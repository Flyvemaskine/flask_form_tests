To do:

* Fix image upload
- Display loaded image
- If image fails, it refreshes page and you lose fields? Possible to make this a popup warning?
* Validate that ownership system works, that paths are only accessible to the correct people.
* Fix page_dir variable to be less hardcoded and admin variables as well
* Add validation to editing form (valid ids)
* Change flash message colors
